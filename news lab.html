		<h1 id="demo 1"> <font size="6px">Huge explosion in Russian city</font> </h1>
		<p> <font size="4px">A <b>large explosion</b> has been reported overnight in the <i>Rostov-on-Don</i> region of southern Russia.

Eyewitness reports, which have not been verified by Sky News, say a large flash was seen by residents before they lost power in their apartments. Video of the reported blast has been circulating online.

Reports suggested it occurred at an electricity substation.

Quotes attributed to the Rostov mayor's office suggest the explosion and subsequent power outage stemmed from the water treatment facilities of JSC Rostovvodokanal, which designs water supply and drainage systems.

The statement says there was a malfunction of the pumping equipment, which also left residents without a steady water supply for some hours.

We'll bring you more details on this as we get them.</font> </p>
